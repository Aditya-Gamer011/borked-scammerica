Bank of Scammerica
A chaotic, intentionally absurd web-based registration form that's part parody, part interactive experience. This is not a real bank, and definitely not a scam (probably).

What is this?
Bank of Scammerica is a darkly humorous take on the typical over-complicated, sketchy registration process. It features:

A deliberately broken registration form with ridiculous field requirements (temperature in Kelvin, credit card via slider, age in seconds)

A 60-second countdown timer that triggers gravity effects, making everything fall off the page

A "fleeing" submit button that runs away from your cursor

Autocorrect that changes normal names to chaotic alternatives

Random system warnings and surveillance notifications

A success modal with fake confirmations about data being "sent to the NSA" and "backed up to Dave's laptop"

How to Use
Just open the HTML file in a browser. Click the "Register Now" button to start the chaos.

Features
Registration Form: Fill out ridiculous fields (phone number slider, credit card slider, body temperature in Kelvin)

Gravity Timer: A 60-second countdown timer. When it hits zero, every element on the form falls down the page

Fleeing Button: Try to click the submit button - it moves away from you

Autocorrect: Type a common name in the name field and watch it get corrupted (John becomes PIZZA MAN, etc.)

Live Password Display: Your login password displays in plain text as you type it

Eye Cursor: A custom cursor that follows you around

Random Notifications: Creepy surveillance messages pop up randomly

The Gravity Effect
When the timer reaches zero, every element on the registration form falls down the page. The warning banner, header, form fields, close button - all of it tumbles down. It's the only "punishment" for taking too long to register.
